# CyberSwarmAI README.md 

## Overview
**CyberSwarmAI** is an open source project created to build a multi-step verification python program to detect malware/viruses that use complex AI encryption to mask themselves from traditional systems. The project uses ML models & NLP to identify malicious behaviour & flags risks, creating a powerful platform for cybersecurity. It is a work in progress, part of a prototype, and is intended to be built upon and extended for greater impact in the cyber security world. Though some APIs used in the program may not be released to public due to licensing agreements, this project serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to create an open source alternative. Any programs designed with this code must be updated to run on the reader's own machine, as URLs and possible keys may need to be changed to run successfully. 

Finally, to encourage the project’s continued growth, a checkbox has been added at the end of the README.md. Mark it off once the prototype is completed and check back in periodically to see the progress of this project. 

## Goals 
The goal of **CyberSwarmAI** is to build a comprehensive and secure platform to help identify and flag risks in the digital world. The project will utilize ML models & NLP to analyze encrypted data to identify malicious behaviour and keep user’s digital data secure. 

The project will be unique due to its powerful AI capabilities and its robust security protocols:
* Utilizing ML and NLP techniques to unravel complex encryption schemes 
* Implementing verification steps to ensure trustworthiness of data before it is processed 
* Updating the script to run on the user's own machine to maximize adaptability 

## Roadmap 
This roadmap outlines the objectives of **CyberSwarmAI** and the timeline for which they should be completed.

#### Step 1: 
**Timeframe:** Now - August 2023 

* Create a multi-step verification python program to detect malware/viruses
